# DataGridView setup for surveys

Shows how to use a DataGridView to provide an interface for asking questions using mocked radio buttons along with validation that the user made a selection for each row.

The data source for the DataGridView is a DataTable as there is less work involved than using a **BindingList&lt;T>** with a class setup for change notification.

## Framework

.NET Framework 4.8
